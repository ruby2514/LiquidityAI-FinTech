## Slide Order & Talking Points

### Slide 1: Platform Overview
**Image:** `01_platform_overview.png`

**Key Points:**
- Donna aggregates financial data from **5+ sources** (PitchBook, SEC EDGAR, LinkedIn, Crunchbase, CSV/Excel)
- Data flows through an **8-stage ingestion pipeline** — from raw to canonical
- The core platform has three engines: **Knowledge Graph**, **Entity Resolution**, and **LLM Orchestrator**
- Everything sits on top of an enterprise **security layer** with RBAC, risk scoring, and audit logging
- Users interact through **5 specialized interfaces** tailored to different roles

**Demo Action:** Show the Dashboard page — point out the 847K entities, 98.7% ER precision, 99.9% provenance coverage.

---

### Slide 2: Authentication & Security
**Image:** `02_security_auth_flow.png`

**Key Points:**
- **JWT-based authentication** with 15-minute access tokens and 7-day refresh tokens
- **Account lockout** after 5 failed attempts — prevents brute force attacks
- **Session tracking** — every login records IP address, device, and user agent
- **Rate limiting** — 10 auth attempts per 15 minutes, 100 API calls per minute
- **API keys** — scoped, hashed, and prefixed (`donna_sk_`) for programmatic access
- **Every action logged** — immutable audit trail with actor, target, IP, timestamp

**Demo Action:** Log in as DonnaAI → open Profile Panel → show the Sessions tab with IP addresses.

---

### Slide 3: User Registration & Risk Scoring
**Image:** `03_risk_scoring_flow.png`

**Key Points:**
- New users don't get instant access — they **submit a request** with department, title, and reason
- A **risk scoring engine** analyzes each submission (0–100 scale):
  - Disposable email? +25 risk
  - Missing department/title? +15/+10 risk
  - Vague reason? +20 risk
  - No referral? +10 risk
- Admin sees the **risk score and factors** in the approval queue
- Admin can **approve + assign role**, or **deny with a required reason**
- This approach reduces unauthorized access while maintaining a smooth onboarding experience

**Demo Action:** Open Settings → Approvals tab → show the risk score column and approve/deny buttons.

---

### Slide 4: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
**Image:** `04_rbac_model.png`

**Key Points:**
- **7 distinct roles** — from Super Admin (full control) to Viewer (read-only)
- **30+ granular permissions** across 8 categories (users, graph, pipeline, LLM, audit, policies, API keys, sessions)
- **Escalation prevention** — a user cannot assign a role higher than their own
- Roles map directly to **SOC 2 access control requirements**
- Each role sees only the navigation items and features they're authorized for

**Demo Action:** Open Settings → Team tab → show the role dropdown for a user, demonstrate how only certain roles are assignable.

---

### Slide 5: Data Ingestion Pipeline
**Image:** `05_data_pipeline.png`

**Key Points:**
- **8-stage pipeline** takes raw data and produces canonical, high-confidence entities
- Supports **multiple source types**: CSV, Excel, PDF, API feeds
- **AI-assisted** field mapping and LLM enrichment in stages 3 and 6
- **Entity Resolution** in stage 7 detects duplicates using fuzzy matching
- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** review queue for low-confidence matches
- Quality assurance in stage 8 with confidence scoring and anomaly detection
- Final output: **Single Source of Truth (SSOT)** with 847K+ canonical entities

**Demo Action:** Show the Ingestion Pipeline page → walk through each stage → point out the active sources and record counts.

---

### Slide 6: SOC 2 Compliance & Audit
**Image:** `06_audit_compliance.png`

**Key Points:**
- **Immutable, append-only** audit log — entries can never be modified or deleted
- Every event captures: **actor, target, action, IP address, timestamp, outcome**
- **Full user lifecycle** tracking: registration → approval → role changes → suspension → deletion
- **Four security control pillars**:
  1. Authentication (JWT, lockout, MFA-ready)
  2. Authorization (RBAC, permission checks, escalation prevention)
  3. Data Protection (bcrypt hashing, token hashing)
  4. Monitoring (session tracking, IP flagging, rate limiting)
- **Export-ready** for SOC 2 Type II auditors — all log data is queryable and filterable

**Demo Action:** Show the Security & Compliance page → point out the audit event timeline → export a sample report.
