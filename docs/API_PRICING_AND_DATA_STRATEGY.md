# DonnaAI — API & Data Licensing Cost Sheet

**Prepared:** March 2026 | **Purpose:** Pitch-ready breakdown of every external API/data source DonnaAI needs, what it costs, and why.

---

## Executive Summary

DonnaAI requires APIs across **three categories**: financial data sources (the fuel), AI/LLM services (the brain), and people/company enrichment (the connective tissue). Total annual cost ranges from **$7K (bootstrap)** to **$120K+ (enterprise-grade)** depending on data depth.

---

## 1. Financial Data Sources

These are the core data feeds that populate DonnaAI's knowledge graph with organizations, funds, people, and deals.

### Tier A — Premium (Gold Standard)

| Provider | What You Get | Annual Cost | Why We Need It |
|----------|-------------|:-----------:|----------------|
| **PitchBook** | 3.4M+ companies, VC/PE deals, fund data, LP commitments, valuations | **$54K–$100K+** | Most comprehensive private market dataset. Covers the full investment chain: firms → funds → deals → LPs. Required for serious institutional credibility. |
| **Dealroom** | 2M+ companies, EU-focused deal flow, startup ecosystem data | **$15K–$40K** (est.) | Strongest European coverage. Essential if serving cross-border investors or EU-focused family offices. |

> **Verdict:** PitchBook alone could be sufficient for US-focused MVP. Add Dealroom for global coverage. These are the datasets that make DonnaAI valuable — without them, the graph is empty.

### Tier B — Mid-Range (Solid Alternatives)

| Provider | What You Get | Annual Cost | Why We Need It |
|----------|-------------|:-----------:|----------------|
| **Crunchbase Pro** | Funding rounds, company profiles, investor data | **$588/yr** ($49/mo) | Affordable starting point. Good for startup/VC data. Lacks depth on PE, family offices, and LPs. |
| **Crunchbase Business** | Pro + higher export limits, CRM integrations, team access | **$2,388/yr** ($199/mo) | Better for teams. Still missing institutional investor depth. |
| **Crunchbase Enterprise** | Full API access, bulk exports, custom data feeds | **$2K–$10K+/yr** | Best Crunchbase tier. API access allows automated ingestion. Still not PitchBook-level depth. |

> **Verdict:** Crunchbase is the budget-friendly entry point. Start here ($49/mo), graduate to Enterprise when revenue supports it.

### Tier C — Free Government Data

| Provider | What You Get | Annual Cost | Why We Need It |
|----------|-------------|:-----------:|----------------|
| **SEC EDGAR** | All public company filings (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, 20-F), XBRL data, insider ownership | **$0 (Free)** | Legally required disclosures. Rich structured financial data. No API key needed. Rate limit: 10 req/sec. Fund managers' Form ADV filings, 13F holdings — this is gold for tracking institutional portfolios. |

> **Verdict:** Must-use. Free, authoritative, updated in real-time. Build an EDGAR scraper on day one. Every competitor uses this data — not having it is inexcusable.

---

## 2. AI / LLM APIs

These power entity extraction, data classification, enrichment, and entity resolution. DonnaAI routes tasks to the right model based on complexity vs. cost.

### Primary Models

| Provider | Model | Input (per 1M tokens) | Output (per 1M tokens) | Best For |
|----------|-------|:---------------------:|:----------------------:|----------|
| **OpenAI** | GPT-4o | $2.50 | $10.00 | Complex extraction — pulling structured data from SEC filings, classifying investor types, resolving ambiguous entities |
| **OpenAI** | GPT-4o mini | $0.15 | $0.60 | Bulk processing — name normalization, tag classification, simple field extraction. 95% of volume goes here. |
| **Anthropic** | Claude 3.5 Sonnet | $3.00 | $15.00 | High-quality reasoning — entity resolution edge cases, relationship inference, dispute adjudication |
| **Anthropic** | Claude 3.5 Haiku | $1.00 | $5.00 | Mid-tier tasks — data validation, format conversion, structured extraction with moderate complexity |
| **Google** | Gemini 2.5 Flash | $0.30 | $2.50 | Budget alternative to GPT-4o mini. Good for high-volume, lower-stakes tasks. Free tier available for development. |

### Estimated Monthly LLM Spend

| Scenario | Volume | Est. Monthly Cost |
|----------|--------|:-----------------:|
| **Development / Testing** | <100K tokens/day | **$5–$20** |
| **Light Production** (1K entities/day, mostly GPT-4o mini) | ~2M tokens/day | **$50–$100** |
| **Full Production** (10K entities/day, mixed models) | ~20M tokens/day | **$300–$800** |
| **Heavy Production** (100K entities/day, real-time processing) | ~200M tokens/day | **$2K–$5K** |

> **Strategy:** Route 90% of volume to GPT-4o mini ($0.15/1M input). Use GPT-4o or Claude Sonnet only for complex entity resolution and edge cases. This keeps costs under $500/mo for most production workloads.

---

## 3. People & Company Enrichment

These fill in the "who" — partner names, executive roles, contact info, and company firmographics that financial data sources don't always include.

| Provider | What You Get | Pricing | Why We Need It |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| **Apollo.io** (Free) | 100 credits/mo, basic company/people search | **$0** | Testing and development. Very limited for production. |
| **Apollo.io** (Basic) | 2,500 credits/mo, CRM integrations, advanced filters | **$49/user/mo** | Best value for people data enrichment. Covers partner names, titles, current org, email. |
| **Apollo.io** (Professional) | 4,000 credits/mo, sequences, dialer, AI tools | **$79/user/mo** | Good for teams actively enriching data at scale. |
| **People Data Labs** | Person + company search APIs, ethically sourced | **$0.27/credit** (2.5K–5K/mo) | Alternative to Apollo. Clean data, compliance-friendly. Useful if Apollo's dataset has gaps. |
| **Clearbit / Breeze Intelligence** | Company enrichment (HubSpot-integrated) | **$3.6K–$100K+/yr** | Enterprise-only since HubSpot acquisition. Overkill unless already using HubSpot CRM. Skip for now. |

> **Verdict:** Start with **Apollo.io Basic ($49/mo)**. It covers 80% of people enrichment needs. Add People Data Labs for gap-filling if needed.

## 4. LinkedIn Data

LinkedIn is the richest source for people/org relationships, but access is heavily restricted.

| Approach | Cost | Legal Risk | Data Quality |
|----------|:----:|:----------:|:------------:|
| **LinkedIn API (official partner)** | Custom ($10K–$50K+/yr) | ✅ None | ✅ Best |
| **LinkedIn Sales Navigator** | $1,600/seat/yr (Advanced Plus) | ✅ None | ✅ High |
| **Bright Data (scraping proxy)** | $500–$2K/mo | ⚠️ Medium | 🟡 Good |
| **LinkdAPI (post-Proxycurl)** | Custom | ⚠️ Medium | 🟡 Good |
| **Skip LinkedIn entirely** | $0 | ✅ None | ❌ Gap |

> **⚠️ Warning:** Proxycurl (the most popular LinkedIn scraping API) was **shut down in July 2025** after LinkedIn sued them. Direct scraping carries legal risk. **Recommendation:** Use Apollo.io for people data (which includes LinkedIn-sourced info legally), and only pursue official LinkedIn partnership if revenue justifies it.
